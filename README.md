# Automatic Weighing Control System

Automatic Weighing Control System based on ATMega328p controller.

This system was made during my internship in Karya Brawijaya. The system created to replace the equivalent analog system that have been used, this project was meant to simplify and further improvement in controlling the said system.

The microcontroller environment controls the low voltage environment and the 5V Relay controls higher voltage environment for example motor actuation, solenoid valve, etc.

Here below the low voltage level (TTL) Environment of the system
